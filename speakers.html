                        <h5>Heavy metal coding</h5>
                        <p>In this unconventional talk, Chris Mills will encourage you to
                            pick up some drum sticks in addition to your laptop, and beat
                            out a rhythm of learning – both of code and drum beats! You’ll
                            learn basic JavaScript and CSS, plus beginner’s heavy metal
                            drum patterns. The two are a marriage made in heaven, as nothing
                            is a better antidote to code frustration than beating seven shades
                            of **** out of a drum kit.</p>
                        <h5>About Chris</h5>
                        <p>Chris Mills is a Senior Tech Writer at Mozilla, where he writes docs
                            and demos about open web apps, Firefox OS and related subjects. He
                            loves tinkering around with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other web technologies,

                        <h5>Teaching our css to play nice</h5>
                        <p>Talk abstract: As our websites, applications and teams grow larger and more
                            complicated, so does our CSS. Before we know it, we find ourselves no longer
                            with cute little stylesheets, but sprawling, surly teenaged CSS that doesn’t
                            always play nice with others. We need to learn how to manage and optimize our
                            CSS no matter how large the project or diverse the team. If we start early,
                            we can use best practices and tools to raise full-grown stylesheets any
                            designer or developer would be happy to work with.</p>
